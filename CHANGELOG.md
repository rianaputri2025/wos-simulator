# Changelog: Interactive Modals & UX Overhaul v1.4

**Release Date:** June 23, 2025

Version 1.4 is a significant user experience (UX) and quality-of-life update, focusing on a complete overhaul of the modal system and introducing highly interactive components for setting levels in both simulators.

---

### ‚ú® Major Features & Improvements

- **Interactive Level Selector**

  - Replaced standard number inputs in the "Set Start Levels" modal with a fully custom, interactive dropdown component for both **Gear and Charm simulators**.
  - Dropdown options now display the corresponding **Gear or Charm icon**, making level selection more intuitive and visual.
  - The new dropdowns are "smart" and will **automatically open** if there is not enough space below, preventing the list from being cut off.

- **UI/UX Enhancements**

  - Scrollbars within all modals are now **custom-styled** to match the application's dark theme, creating a more polished and unified look.
  - Alert/notification modals have an **improved layout** with better spacing for visual consistency.

- **Internationalization (i18n) Expansion**
  - Added comprehensive translations for all 42 gear rarity levels.
  - Added new keys and translations for gear slot names (`Cap`, `Coat`, etc.) across all supported languages.

### üêû Critical Bug Fixes & Optimizations

- **[FATAL] Fixed Background Scrolling Bug**

  - Resolved a critical UX bug where the main page body could still be scrolled when a modal was active. The background is now correctly "locked" by applying an `overflow: hidden` class to the `<body>` element.

- **Complete Modal System Overhaul**
  - Fixed a major layout issue where modal content (headers or buttons) could be pushed off-screen. Modals are now always perfectly centered, with **internal content scrolling** independently.
  - All modal open/close events were refactored to use a centralized JavaScript function (`showModal`/`hideModal`), ensuring consistent behavior and preventing bugs.

## üöÄ Bug Fixes & Optimizations

- **[FATAL] Fixed Zero-Material Upgrade Bug:** Corrected a critical bug where users could upgrade gear even with zero required materials. The material validation logic has been restored to the stable, original version.

- **[FATAL] Fixed Gear Preview Position Bug:**

  - Completely removed the unstable JavaScript-based positioning method (`updateGearPreviewPosition`) that caused the preview to jump or be misplaced.
  - Replaced it with a **pure CSS method** (`position` + `transform`) that guarantees a perfectly centered and stable preview on all devices.

- **Fixed "Set Start Levels" Modal Sync Bug:** Resolved an issue where the modal did not display the most recent gear levels after an upgrade.

- **Fixed Modals Not Appearing Bug:** Corrected a JavaScript logic error where some modals would not appear. This was fixed by restoring the modal's inner HTML content.

- **Comprehensive Mobile Responsive Fixes:**

  - Adjusted font sizes, padding, and margins across the simulator page for a clean layout on small screens.
  - Ensured the gear layout no longer touches the screen edges.
  - Corrected the size of the preview image, which was previously too large on mobile devices.

- **Other Improvements:**
  - Fixed the spacing between star icons (‚≠ê) on the gear display.
  - Ensured all sound effects (click, upgrade) are working correctly again.
  - Created a single, self-contained `gears.css` file to handle all styling for the simulator page, avoiding conflicts.
