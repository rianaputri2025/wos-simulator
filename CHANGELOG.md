## ‚ú® New Features & Visual Enhancements

### üé® Complete UI Overhaul

- Replaced the old color theme with a modern, clean, and professional **Violet & Indigo** palette.
- Introduced a **gradient effect** on key elements like titles and buttons for a premium look.
- Implemented the **Poppins** font from Google Fonts for improved typography across the site.

### üè† Completely New Homepage

- Removed the main navigation header and replaced it with a minimalist design (logo only at the top) for a more focused experience.
- Added a clear **call-to-action button** within the description card to direct users straight to the simulator.

### üåü Interactive Icon Animations

- Added hover animations to the feature icons on the homepage.
- The gear icon (`fa-cogs`) now features **counter-rotating gears** for a realistic mechanical effect, implemented using a custom SVG.

## üöÄ Bug Fixes & Optimizations

- **[FATAL] Fixed Zero-Material Upgrade Bug:** Corrected a critical bug where users could upgrade gear even with zero required materials. The material validation logic has been restored to the stable, original version.

- **[FATAL] Fixed Gear Preview Position Bug:**

  - Completely removed the unstable JavaScript-based positioning method (`updateGearPreviewPosition`) that caused the preview to jump or be misplaced.
  - Replaced it with a **pure CSS method** (`position` + `transform`) that guarantees a perfectly centered and stable preview on all devices.

- **Fixed "Set Start Levels" Modal Sync Bug:** Resolved an issue where the modal did not display the most recent gear levels after an upgrade.

- **Fixed Modals Not Appearing Bug:** Corrected a JavaScript logic error where some modals would not appear. This was fixed by restoring the modal's inner HTML content.

- **Comprehensive Mobile Responsive Fixes:**

  - Adjusted font sizes, padding, and margins across the simulator page for a clean layout on small screens.
  - Ensured the gear layout no longer touches the screen edges.
  - Corrected the size of the preview image, which was previously too large on mobile devices.

- **Other Improvements:**
  - Fixed the spacing between star icons (‚≠ê) on the gear display.
  - Ensured all sound effects (click, upgrade) are working correctly again.
  - Created a single, self-contained `gears.css` file to handle all styling for the simulator page, avoiding conflicts.
