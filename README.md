# WOS Simulators: Gear & Charm

Welcome to **WOS Simulators**, a suite of web-based tools created by [Oriana](https://github.com/rianaputri2025) to help you simulate gear and charm upgrades, calculate total material usage, and plan efficiently in **Whiteout Survival**.

🎯 **Purpose**
This simulator is designed purely for planning and calculation. It helps you understand how many materials you’ll need to upgrade your equipment to the maximum level — **not for cheating or illegal activity**.
