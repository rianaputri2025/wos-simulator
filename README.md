# Chief Gear Simulator

Welcome to **Chief Gear Simulator**, a simple yet powerful web-based tool created by [Oriana](https://github.com/orianadev) to help you simulate gear upgrades, calculate total material usage, and plan efficiently based on your in-game progress in **Whiteout Survival**.

🎯 **Purpose**  
This simulator is designed purely for planning and calculation. It helps you understand how many materials you’ll need to upgrade your gear to the maximum level — **not for cheating or illegal activity**.
